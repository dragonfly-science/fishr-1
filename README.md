This repo contains code to implement methods proposed by Joy and Death (2004) for calculating a Index of Biotic Integrity with application to New Zealand fish communities. It also updates these methods by utilising quantile regression to define the Maximum Species Richness Lines (used for scoring metrics), as first used by Joy (2007) for the Waikato region.
