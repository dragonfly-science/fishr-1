Title: Calculates fish IBI for New Zealand fish communities
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Isaac Bain
Maintainer: Isaac Bain <isaac.bain@mfe.govt.nz>
Description: This repo contains code to implement methods proposed by Joy and
    Death (2004) for calculating a Index of Biotic Integrity with application to
    New Zealand fish communities. It also updates these methods by utilising quantile
    regression to define the Maximum Species Richness Lines (used for scoring metrics),
    as first used by Joy (2007) for the Waikato region.
